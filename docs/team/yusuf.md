## Project Description
Food waste is a widespread problem within local communities. Many individuals and
households regularly dispose of surplus food that is still fresh and safe to eat, often due to
overbuying, changes in plans, or lack of awareness of alternatives. At the same time, other
members of the same community — such as students, low-income households, or people living
alone — may struggle to access affordable meals or rely on limited food options.
This project aims to address this imbalance by creating a community-focused web application
that makes it easy for people to share surplus food locally in a safe, respectful, and organised
way. Rather than focusing on buying and selling, the platform encourages mutual support and
cooperation, allowing users to offer excess food items to others who may benefit from them.
Through the application, users will be able to list surplus food items with relevant details such
as category, quantity, and availability, browse food shared by others in their area, and
coordinate collection in a clear and transparent manner. By facilitating these interactions, the
system helps reduce unnecessary waste while strengthening connections between community
members.
The intended outcome of the application is not only to reduce food waste, but also to promote
more sustainable habits and foster a sense of trust and shared responsibility within local
communities. Over time, the platform could help normalise food sharing as a positive, everyday
action rather than a last resort.
From a technical perspective, the application will be implemented as a full-stack, databasedriven web system using Node.js, Express, MySQL, and the PUG templating engine. Docker will
be used to ensure a consistent development environment across the team, and GitHub Actions
will support basic CI/CD workflows. These tools will enable the team to collaborate effectively
while delivering a reliable and maintainable solution.
