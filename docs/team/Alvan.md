## Ethical Issues: 
# Food Safety and Hygiene
There is a risk that shared food may be unsafe to consume if it has been stored, prepared, or
handled incorrectly. To mitigate this risk, the application will clearly inform users that food is
shared at their own risk and provide basic food safety and hygiene guidelines to reduce
potential health issues.
# User Privacy, Transparency, and Trust
The platform may involve sharing personal information such as names, approximate locations,
or collection times, creating risks related to privacy and misuse of information. This will be
mitigated by limiting the amount of personal data displayed, only sharing necessary details, and
requiring clear and honest food listings to promote trust and transparency between users.
# Misuse of the Platform for Non-Community Purposes
There is a risk that users may exploit the platform by repeatedly claiming food without genuine
need or reselling items for profit, which conflicts with the platform’s cooperative and noncommercial purpose. This risk can be reduced through community guidelines, reporting
mechanisms, and potential limits on how frequently users can claim food.
# Fairness and Equal Access to Shared Food
A small number of users could dominate available food listings, preventing others from
benefiting equally. To promote fairness, the system can include measures such as claim limits,
prioritisation of users who have not recently collected food, or visibility controls to ensure wider
access.
# Encouraging Responsible Food Practices
There is an ethical risk that the platform could unintentionally encourage food overproduction
or unsafe food handling by normalising excess food creation. This will be addressed by clearly
communicating that the application exists to reduce waste rather than replace responsible food
planning or safe food preparation practices.
# Accountability and Community Moderation
Without accountability, harmful behaviour such as misleading listings, harassment, or disputes
during food collection could occur. This can be mitigated by introducing reporting tools, clear
community rules, and moderation processes to resolve conflicts and maintain a safe and
respectful environment.
