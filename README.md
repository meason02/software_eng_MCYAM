# Food Waste Management – Community Sharing App
A community‑focused web application designed to reduce food waste by enabling people to share surplus food quickly, safely, and conveniently. The platform supports individuals, families, students, and small businesses who may either have extra food to give away or need access to affordable options.


## Project description
Across many households and small food businesses, surplus food is often thrown away despite still being fresh and edible. At the same time, others in the community — such as students, people on tight budgets, and families — may struggle to access affordable meals.
This application provides a simple, approachable solution by allowing users to:

- List surplus food with clear details
- Browse available items nearby
- Arrange quick, safe collection
- Mark when food has been picked up

The design focuses on being fast to use, easy to understand, and helpful for people with different levels of technical confidence. Whether someone is giving away a single home‑cooked meal, a café is offering leftover pastries at the end of the day, or a family is sharing extra groceries — the platform supports it in a clean and accessible way.

## Key Features
Create Food Listings
Allows users to quickly upload information about surplus food, including:

- Item name
- Quantity
- Category
- Pickup window
- Optional notes (allergy information, preparation details)

This feature is ideal for both individuals and small businesses who want a fast, low‑effort listing process.

### Browse Available Food
Visitors can easily search and filter available items:

- View nearby food
- Filter by category
- Check availability time
- See collection instructions

The browsing experience is designed for clarity and speed, helping users make decisions quickly and without confusion.

### Mark Food as Collected
Once the food has been picked up:

- The lister can mark it as collected
- The item is removed from active listings
- This keeps the platform up‑to‑date and reliable


### Simple, Friendly Interface
The platform uses:

- Clear wording
- Straightforward navigation
- Minimal steps
- Mobile‑friendly views

This ensures accessibility for users who may not be confident with complex digital systems.

### Support for Community Values
The platform emphasises:

- Sharing without stigma
- Transparency and trust
- Safety in pickup arrangements
- Encouraging sustainable habits

This helps create a welcoming community environment.
